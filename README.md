# Singaporean Speech Classification with Neural Networks - Capstone Project

## Problem Statement

Speech recognition programmes have the ability to convert voice to text, mostly by building a Speech-To-Text (STT) model using Machine Learning. This type of STT programmes are common seen in smart phones or other websites which are have speech-enabled inputs. However, many of these "off-the-shelves" speech recognition programmes have difficulty recognising Singaporean accented English as they are not trained with Singaporean speeches. Furthermore, Singaporeans do not speak with one universal accent, making it even more challenging for speech recognition models.

I would like to find out if it is possible for machines to understand Singaporean accent. In data science terms, I wish to find out if its possible for machines to classify Singaporean accents corrently.

To investigate this, a multi-classification model will be built, with a total of 5 classes. The machine learning algorithm used will be mainly neural networks, consisting of a regular Feedforward Neural Network, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 

This is my Capstone Project for my Data Science Immersive (DSI) course, conducted by General Assembly. It is a developing project and is expected to complete by 10 November 2020.
