The entire corpus is organised into a few parts. 

Part 1 features about 1000 hours of prompted recordings of phonetically-balanced scripts from about 1000 local English speakers. 

Part 2 presents about 1000 hours of prompted recordings of sentences randomly generated from words based on people, food, location, brands, etc, from about 1000 local English speakers as well. Transcriptions of the recordings have been done orthographically and are available for download.

Part 3 consists of about 1000 hours of conversational data recorded from about 1000 local English speakers, split into pairs. The data includes conversations covering daily life and of speakers playing games provided. 

Parts 1 and 2 were recorded in quiet rooms using 3 microphones: a headset/ standing microphone (channel 0), a boundary microphone (channel 1), and a mobile phone (channel 3). Recordings that are available for download here have been down-sampled to 16kHz. Details of the microphone models used for each speaker as well as some corresponding non-personal and anonymized information can be found in the accompanying spreadsheets. 

Part 3's recordings were split into 2 environments. In the Same Room environment where speakers were in same room, the recordings were done using 2 microphones: a close-talk mic and a boundary mic. In the Separate Room environment, speakers were separated into individual rooms. The recordings were done using 2 microphones in each room: a standing mic and a telephone. 

Part 4 contains recordings of 2 different natures. 
Under Codeswitching, speakers were encouraged as best as possible to switch from Singapore English to their Mother Tongue languages. These recordings were done under two environments. In the Same Room recordings, speakers sit at least two metres apart and record using their mobile phones. In the Different Room environment, speakers would speak through each other via Zoom on their laptops, and recording using their mobile phones. 
Under Topics Based, speakers were made to speak following the 4 styles: Debate, Finance topics, Positive Emotion and Negative Emotions. All recordings were done in a Separate room session, via Zoom, where the audio is recorded using the mobile phone. 


Directory Structure

The root folder contains subdirectories for Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3, a LEXICON subdirectory, a LICENCE file and a VERSION file. 

Part 1 and Part 2’s subdirectories are further organized into a DATA subdirectory, DOC folder for speaker and microphone information and transcription documentation, as well as a PROMPT INFO file. The DATA directory contains the audio recordings and corresponding transcriptions organized by the channel. The structure is as follows: 
•	/SCRIPT: containing orthographic transcripts saved in TXT format and organized by speaker number and session number (0 or 1)
•	/WAVE: containing audio files in WAV format, sampled at 16kHz, zipped into folders by the speaker number. Each folder further separates the audio files by the session number.

Part 3 is further organised into a six subdirectories, 3 for each recording environment (Same Room or Separate Room). Among each group of 3 subdirectories, 1 contains transcriptions, while the remaining 2 contain audio data from each of the two microphones used for the environment. There is also a manifest document at the root of the Part 3 folder that lists the files released.
